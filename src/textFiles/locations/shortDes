You are standing by a river. 
You are standing in a hall.
You are standing at a beach.
You are in the rabbit house.
You are in the rest area.
You are in the woods.
You are in the dark forest.
You are in the darkness.
You are in the rainforest.
You are in the queens house.
You are in the courthouse.
