You are standing by a river. All of the sudden, you see a rabbit run down a hole! Head south to follow him ...
You are standing in a big hall. The ceilings are very high. You see the white rabbit running from corner to corner dropping several items along the way... You notice two doors to the east and west. 
You are standing at a beach with rolling waves coming in from the sea. The rabbit sits on the sand smiling with gratitude.
You are in the rabbit's house. It is full of carrots and strange odds and ends. Its rather cramped but you can fit just fine if you crouch.
You are in the rest area. There is a picnic bench with some food on it. 
You are in the woods. They are very dark and you feel like you are being watched... 
You are in the dark forest. Even darker than the woods, you definitely feel this is less safe. 
You are in the darkness. It is pitch black here but you are certain you are not alone. 
You are in the rainforest. It is less dark here but still dangerous.
You are in the queens house. Everything here is made of gold and silver with a long dinner table stretching up to a figure sitting in the throne. 
You are in the courthouse. This is the place you had to get to in order to leave wonderland. There are living cards and a judge sitting there waiting to hear you plea to leave Wonderland.
